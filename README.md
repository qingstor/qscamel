## Quick start

Create a task file like following and save as `example-task.yaml`:

```yaml
type: copy

source:
  type: fs
  path: /path/to/source

destination:
  type: qingstor
  path: /path/to/destination
  options:
    bucket_name: example_bucket
    access_key_id: example_access_key_id
    secret_access_key: example_secret_access_key
```

Use qscamel:

```bash
qscamel run example-task -t example-task.yaml
```

Have a cup of tea and you will see all file under `/path/to/source` will be migrated to qingstor bucket `example_bucket` with prefix `/path/to/destination`.

See the detailed usage with `qscamel -h` or `qscamel --help`, and read the following docs.

## Installation

Get the latest qscamel for Linux, macOS and Windows from [releases](https://github.com/yunify/qscamel/releases)

## Configuration

qscamel has following config options:

```yaml
# concurrency controls haw many goroutine run at the same time.
# if not set or set to 0, qscamel will use the numer of logic CPU * 100.
concurrency: 0
# log_level controls the log_level.
# Available value (from more to less): debug, info, warn, error, fatal, panic.
# Default value: info
log_level: info
# pid_file controls where the pid file will create.
# Default value: ~/.qscamel/qscamel.pid
pid_file: ~/.qscamel/qscamel.pid
# log_file controls where the log file will create.
# Default value: ~/.qscamel/qscamel.log
log_file: ~/.qscamel/qscamel.log
# database_file controls where the database folder will create.
# Default value: ~/.qscamel/db
database_file: ~/.qscamel/db
# Proxy that qscamel used to connect endpoint.
proxy: ""
```

The default config will read from `~/.qscamel/qscamel.yaml`, you can also specify the config path with flag `-c` or `--config`.

For example:

```bash
qscamel run example-task -t example-task.yaml -c /path/to/config/file
```

## Usage

### Run

Run is the main command for qscamel. We can use this command to create or resume a task.

In order to create a new task, we can use:

```bash
qscamel run task-name -t /path/to/task/file
```

In order to resume a task, we can use:

```bash
qscamel run task-name -t /path/to/task/file
```

or

```bash
qscamel run task-name
```

> When a new task created, we will calculate the sha256 checksum for it's content and save it to the database, and we will check if the content of the task file has been changed, if changed, qscamel will return an error. In other word, task can't be changed after created. If your need to update the task, please create a new one.

### Delete

Delete can delete a task.

```bash
qscamel delete task-name
```

### Status

Status will show the task status.

```bash
qscamel status
```

### Clean

Clean will delete all the finished tasks.

```bash
qscamel clean
```

### Version

Version will show the current version of qscamel.

```bash
qscamel version
```
